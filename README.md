Achieving best accuracy by implementing Newton raphson method in Logistic Regression

I started to implement the logistic regression function with newton. Initially as stated in the problem we split the data into 10 folds. 
The data is split using the sklearn function test_train_split.
Then the training and testing data is generated randomly since we used the random_state=None. The splitting of data is random.

Attached ipynb notebooks also demonstrate comparision of prediction accuracy using differnt methods in logistic regression
